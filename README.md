SpreeBraintree-cse
==================

Introduction goes here.

Installation
------------

Add spree_braintree_cse to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'spree_braintree_cse', github: 'boomerdigital/spree_braintree_cse'
```

Bundle your dependencies and run the installation generator:

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rails g spree_braintree_client_side:install
```

Testing
-------

First bundle your dependencies, then run `rake`. `rake` will default to building the dummy app if it does not exist, then it will run specs. The dummy app can be regenerated by using `rake test_app`.

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rake
```

When testing your applications integration with this extension you may use it's factories.
Simply add this require statement to your spec_helper:

```ruby
require 'spree_braintree_cse/factories'
```

Todo
----

Fraud protection and 3D-Secure were added to this plugin. I didn't add a way
to disable them as it seems you would always want it. But if there is a real
reason to need them disabled those options should be added.
